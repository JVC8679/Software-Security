# Software-Security
CS-305

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial desires to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking steps to protect the organization from external threats.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I did well at identifying current vulnerabilities in the code base through the use of static testing. Secure coding is important to prevent data theft and to protect the company's reputation of integrity and reliability.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The dependency check tool was very helpful, saving a lot of time in detecting vulnerabilities automatically instead of having to manually check each dependency for vulnerabilities.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
I refactored the code to incorporate Https which is more secure than Http. In the future I would probably do whichever process is most secure at the moment. Also, contunue using the dependency check tool.

# How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
It was necessary to re-run the dependency check if new dependencies were added. Otherwise, unit testing and manual code review can ensure functionality.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the Internet to research current practices and algorithms and found that very helpful. Using the maven tools to detect the vunerabillities was very helpful and will continue to be useful in the future.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
The use of static testing and research that I did to complete the projects. Also, my experience with supressing false-positives, identifying vunerabillities and about creating a secure Https application.
